Here is the runtime data storage for HotSpot VM In Java 8

- Heap
	- Has got all your objects created using `new`, including String constant pool
	- Contains your fields/instance variables
- MetaSpace(Method Area)
	- Contains static data(Class variables and static methods)
	- Data in here is accessible by Heap, JVM stack
	- Unlike <=Java7 PermGen which takes JVM process memory which is limited and can't be expanded at runtime. MetaSpace uses native memory
- JVM Stack
	- non static methods
	- Current execution of your program.
	- Contains local variables
	- It's a thread
- Native Stack
	- Used for native method executions, as Java core language has some native stuff
	- It's also a thread
- PC register/ Instruction Sets
	- Holds the JVM memory addresses(Not Native address) for each JVM instruction in your stack
	- Generally each entry in JVM/native stack refers to PC registers for addresses to get actual data from Heap/MetaSpace
	- Each stack is associated with a PC register

# 对象

Object o = new Object()

Créer o dans heap, il contient un adresse d'instance dans stack, l'instance dans stack contient:

1. Markword 8 bytes
	1. 锁信息，3 bytes
	2. hashCode信息，4 bytes
	3. gc信息
2. Classpointer 4 bytes, qui oriente Object.class dans méthode area
3. Instance Data
4. padding 补齐8x

- 数组
- volatile关键字
